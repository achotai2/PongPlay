THERES A SENSE IN WHICH WORKING MEMORY WORKS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT I HAVE NOW, BUT THE RESULTS ARE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
I THINK IS BECAUSE WORKING MEMORY IMPOSES A CORRECT CHOICE AT A PARTICULAR LOCATION. STIM METHOD USES THE STIMULATED SEGMENTS TO VOTE ON
THE ACTIVE CELL AT A LOCATION; THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE VOTE IS ONGOING, AND SO OTHER SEGMENTS CAN CHANGE THE WINNER AS THEY BECOME STIMULATED.
THIS DOESNT HAPPEN WITH WORKING MEMORY BECAUSE THE SEGMENTS GET IMPOSED ON BY THE WINNER, AND ALSO THERE IS ONLY ONE WINNER AND ONE ACTIVE CELL,
WHERAS HERE WE HAVE MANY ACTIVE FOR EACH SEGMENT. CAN I JUST RESTRICT IT BACK TO ONLY ONE ACTIVE CELL IN A SEGMENT? THEN THE SEGMENTS WHICH PREDICT THE
PREDICT CELLS THAT ARENT CHOSEN AS THE FEATURE SET WINNER SIMPLY HAVE THEIR TERMINAL SYNAPSES DECAY UNTIL THEY ARE MARKED FOR DELETION. THE WINNER IS
CHOSEN BY, IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE ACTIVE SEGMENTS, THE ONE WITH THE STRONGEST TERMINAL CONNECTION.

CHANGES TO MAKE:
-	ONLY ONE INCIDENT CELL PER COLUMN FOR SEGMENTS. THE INCIDENT CELL IS THE CHOSEN WINNER.
-	ONLY ONE TERMINAL CELL PER COLUMN FOR SEGMENTS. THE TERMINAL CELL IS THE CHOSEN WINNER.
-	THE WINNER IS CHOSEN RANDOMLY FOR BURSTING CELLS, AND IF MULTIPLE PREDICTED IN COLUMN THEN IT IS THE SEGMENT WITH STRONGEST TERMINAL PERMANENCE.
-	SEGMENTS WITH NON-WINNER TERMINALS GET THEIR PERMANENCE DECREASED.
